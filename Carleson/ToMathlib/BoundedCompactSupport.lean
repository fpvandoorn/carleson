# Bounded compactly supported measurable functions

Bounded compactly supported measurable functions are a very convenient class of functions:
it is contained in all `Lᵖ` spaces (in particular they are `Integrable`)
and it is closed under many common operations

Often it is enough to reason with bounded compactly supported functions (as done in the blueprint).
Here we provide helper lemmas mostly meant to streamline integrability proofs.

Todo: make `Mathlib.Tactic.FunProp` work for this
